# **📘1: Introduction to react**

* **What is React?**

  1. Open-source **JavaScript library** (not a framework).

  2. **Focus**: building user interfaces (UI).

  3. Does not handle routing, HTTP, or other features — but integrates well with other libraries.

* **Why Learn React?**

  1. Created & maintained by **Facebook (Meta)**.

  2. Huge community, active ecosystem, tons of support.

  3. Highly in-demand skill in the job market.

* **Core Strengths**:

  1. **Component-based architecture** → break down apps into reusable pieces (e.g., header, footer, article).

  2. **Declarative paradigm** → tell React *what* you want, not *how* to do it.

  3. **Efficient UI updates** via virtual DOM.

  4. **Flexible** → can be used in small parts of a page, full apps, or even mobile with React Native.

Perfect 👌 Let’s treat this like **beginner-friendly detailed lecture notes** for the **2nd video** (Creating First React App). I’ll explain step by step so it feels like a class handout.

---

# 

# **📘2: Creating Your First React Application**

### **1\. Development Environment Setup**

Before writing React code, we need:

* **Node.js**

  * React projects rely on Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager).

  * Download latest **LTS (stable)** version from [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

  * Installing Node automatically gives you **npm** and **npx**.

* **Text Editor**

  * Recommended: **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** → download from [https://code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

  * Lightweight, great React support with extensions.

---

### **2\. Creating a React App with Create React App (CRA)**

React projects need a setup (bundler, transpiler, dev server, etc.). Doing it manually is complex.  
 That’s where **Create React App** comes in.

* **What is Create React App (CRA)?**

  1. A command-line tool that sets up a complete React project with sensible defaults.

  2. Zero configuration → you can start coding right away.

* **Steps to create app**:

  1. Open **VS Code** → create/open a folder (example: `react`).

  2. Open the **integrated terminal**.  
  3. Run the command:

      **npx create-react-app hello-world**  
  4. CRA generates a new folder called `hello-world` containing the project files.

---

### **3\. Running the React App**

Once CRA finishes:

Navigate into the project:

 cd hello-world

1. 

Start the development server:

 npm start

2.   
3. Your default browser opens at [**http://localhost:3000**](http://localhost:3000/).

   * Displays the starter React page (“Edit App.js…” message).

---

### **4\. Editing Your App**

* Open `src/App.js`.

* Change the text inside the `<div>` to **"Hello World"**.

* Save the file.

* Browser **auto-refreshes** → now you see `"Hello World"` displayed.

* 🎉 Congratulations → your first React app is running\!

---

### **5\. Two Ways to Use Create React App**

#### **✅ Method 1: Using npx (Recommended)**

npx create-react-app my-app

* `npx` is an npm package runner (comes with Node.js).

* Downloads CRA temporarily, runs it, and removes it.

* Always uses the **latest version**.

* No need to install CRA globally.

* Cleaner and easier for beginners.

#### **⚠️ Method 2: Using npm (Global Install)**

npm install \-g create-react-app  
create-react-app my-app

* Installs CRA **globally**.

* Stays on your machine until updated manually.

* Can cause version issues if CRA changes in future.

* That’s why this method is less recommended.

---

Perfect 👍 Let’s redo **Lecture 3 (Folder Structure & Control Flow)** with the enriched approach — same topic as the video, but with **extra explanations, modern React (v18) updates, and beginner-friendly clarity**.

---

# **📘 Lecture 3: React Project Folder Structure & Control Flow**

**\- Using npx/npm:**

## **1\. Root Level Files**

When CRA finishes, you see **3 main folders** and a few files at the project root:

* **`package.json`**

  * Manages the project.

  * Lists **dependencies** (e.g., React, ReactDOM).

  * Contains **scripts**:

    * `npm start` → runs development server.

    * `npm run build` → builds app for production.

    * `npm test` → runs tests.

    * `npm run eject` → exposes hidden CRA config (advanced).

* **`package-lock.json` / `yarn.lock`**

  * Auto-generated by npm/yarn.

  * Ensures everyone installing the project gets the **exact same versions** of dependencies.

  * You don’t edit these manually.

* **`.gitignore`**

  * Lists files/folders Git should not track (e.g., `node_modules/`, build files).

* **`README.md`**

  * Contains instructions.

  * Good place to add project documentation.

---

## **2\. Important Folders**

### **📂 `node_modules`**

* Contains **all installed packages** (thousands of files).

* Generated when you run `npm install`.

* **Never upload to GitHub** (ignored using `.gitignore`).

* Can be safely deleted → restored by running `npm install`.

---

### **📂 `public`**

* Contains static files that don’t go through the bundler.

* Contents are copied “as-is” into the build.

Key files inside:

* **`index.html`** → the **only HTML file** in your app.

  * React builds **Single Page Applications (SPA)**.

  * All UI changes happen dynamically inside this file.

Important part:

 \<div id="root"\>\</div\>

*  This empty div is where React injects your entire app.

* `favicon.ico` → small browser tab icon.

* `manifest.json` → for Progressive Web Apps (ignore as a beginner).

👉 As a beginner, **only `index.html` matters**. You rarely touch it, except maybe to change `<title>` or add meta tags.

---

### **📂 `src` (Source)**

This is where you write your React code.

Key files:

* **`index.js`** → Entry point of the React app.

  * Tells React to render the root component (`App`) into the root DOM node.

React 17 and earlier:

 import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';  
ReactDOM.render(\<App /\>, document.getElementById('root'));

* 

React 18 (modern):

 import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';  
const root \= ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));  
root.render(\<App /\>);

*   
* **`App.js`** → The **root component** of your app.

  * Whatever UI you define here is what appears in the browser.

Example:

 function App() {  
  return \<h1\>Hello World\</h1\>;  
}

*   
* **`App.css`** → Styles for the App component.

* **`index.css`** → Global styles applied to the whole app.

* **`App.test.js`** → Basic test (can ignore for now).

* **`logo.svg`** → React logo used in starter template.

* **`reportWebVitals.js`** → For performance measuring (optional, can ignore as a beginner).

* **`setupTests.js`** → Config for testing (can ignore at this stage).

---

## **3\. Control Flow When Running the App**

When you run:

npm start

Step-by-step:

1. **Development server** starts and serves `public/index.html`.

2. Browser loads `index.html`.

   * Finds `<div id="root"></div>`.

3. **`src/index.js`** runs.

   * React tells the browser: *render the `App` component inside the `#root` div.*

4. **`src/App.js`** executes.

   * Returns JSX (React’s HTML-like syntax).

   * JSX gets converted to JavaScript and rendered into the DOM.

5. Browser updates → UI appears.

---

## **4\. Visual Flow**

index.html (public/) → \<div id="root"\>\</div\>  
        ↓  
index.js (src/) → ReactDOM.createRoot(\#root).render(\<App /\>)  
        ↓  
App.js (src/) → defines UI (JSX → HTML)  
        ↓  
Browser UI

---

**\- Using Vite:**

## **1\. Root-Level Files and Folders**

When you open your project, you’ll see several files and folders at the top level:

### **📂 `node_modules/`**

* Stores all installed dependencies (React, Vite, etc.).

* Auto-generated when you run `npm install`.

* ⚠️ Never edit manually.

---

### **📂 `public/`**

* Contains static files that are served as they are.

* Example: `vite.svg`.

* If you put a file here, you can access it directly in the browser at `/filename`.

* Use this for things that don’t change, like `robots.txt` or favicons.

---

### **📄 `index.html`**

* Unlike CRA (where it’s hidden in `public`), here `index.html` is at the **root**.

* Vite treats it as part of the build pipeline.

* It contains a `<div id="root"></div>` where React injects your app.

It also loads your entry script:

 \<script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"\>\</script\>

* 

---

### **📄 `package.json` and `package-lock.json`**

* `package.json` → describes your project and lists dependencies.

* Includes scripts like:

  * `npm run dev` → start dev server.

  * `npm run build` → build production files.

  * `npm run preview` → preview built app.

* `package-lock.json` → locks exact versions of dependencies.

---

### **📄 `vite.config.js`**

* Configuration file for Vite.

* Lets you add plugins, set aliases, tweak build options.

* Example: adding React plugin.

---

### **📄 `.gitignore`, `README.md`**

* `.gitignore` → tells Git which files to ignore (`node_modules`, build output).

* `README.md` → documentation for your project.

---

### **📄 `tsconfig.json` (if using TypeScript)**

* Since you created a TS-enabled project, you’ll see multiple `tsconfig` files.

* They guide TypeScript on how to compile your code.

---

## **2\. 📂 `src/` Folder — The Heart of Your App**

This is where your **actual React code** lives. Let’s go inside:

### **📂 `assets/`**

* For images, fonts, and static files **imported into components**.

* Unlike `public/`, files here are processed by Vite (optimized, hashed).

### **📂 `components/`**

* Where you keep reusable React components.

* Example: `Header.jsx`, `Button.jsx`, `Footer.jsx`.

* Think of components as **LEGO blocks** that build your app.

### **📂 `lib/`**

* For utility functions, custom hooks, or shared logic.

* Example: `lib/api.js` for fetching data.

### **📄 `App.jsx`**

* The **root component** of your app.

* Defines the UI structure and imports child components.

Example:

 import './App.css'  
function App() {  
  return \<h1\>Hello React with Vite\!\</h1\>  
}  
export default App

* 

### **📄 `App.css`**

* Styles specific to `App.jsx`.

### **📄 `index.css`**

* **Global styles** for the whole project.

* Imported inside `main.jsx`.

### **📄 `main.jsx`**

* The **entry point** for React.

* Mounts `App` into the DOM.

Example:

 import React from 'react'  
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'  
import App from './App.jsx'  
import './index.css'

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(  
  \<React.StrictMode\>  
    \<App /\>  
  \</React.StrictMode\>  
)

* 

---

## **3\. Control Flow of the Application**

Here’s how everything connects when you run `npm run dev`:

1. Vite starts a dev server and serves `index.html`.

2. `index.html` contains `<div id="root"></div>` and loads `/src/main.jsx`.

3. `main.jsx` uses `ReactDOM` to render `<App />` inside `#root`.

4. `App.jsx` defines your main UI.

5. `App.jsx` imports and renders components from `components/`.

6. Components may load images/styles from `assets/`.

7. The browser shows the final UI.

---

## **4\. Beginner’s Focus**

As a beginner, you mainly need to focus on:  
 ✅ `src/main.jsx` → entry point.  
 ✅ `src/App.jsx` → main component.  
 ✅ `src/components/` → build reusable blocks.  
 ✅ `src/assets/` → store and import images/icons.  
 ✅ `App.css` \+ `index.css` → styling.

Other files (`vite.config.js`, `lib/`, TypeScript configs) will matter more as your project grows.

---

## **🔑 Key Takeaway**

* `index.html` has just one job → provide a **root div**.

* `main.jsx` connects React with that root div.

* `App.jsx` defines the UI.

* `components/` makes your app modular and reusable.

React \+ Vite apps are **single-page applications (SPAs)**, meaning the browser loads `index.html` once, and React dynamically updates the UI inside `#root`.

---

Got it 👍  
 Here’s a **clear, beginner-friendly note** on the difference between **`public/`** and **`src/assets/`** in Vite projects. You can keep this as a quick reference guide.

---

# **📘 Public Folder vs Assets Folder in Vite**

## **📂 `public/`**

* **Purpose**: Holds static files that should be served as-is.

* **Processing**: Files are **not processed or renamed** by Vite.

* **Access**: Available at a fixed URL directly in the browser.

  * Example: `public/logo.png` → `http://localhost:5173/logo.png`.

* **When to use**:

  * Favicons (`favicon.ico`)

  * `robots.txt`, `manifest.json`

  * Static PDFs or files you want users to download

* **Production**: Copied into `dist/` unchanged.

  * e.g. `public/logo.png` → `dist/logo.png`.

---

## **📂 `src/assets/`**

* **Purpose**: Holds assets used **inside your React components**.

* **Processing**: Files are processed by Vite:

  * Optimized (compressed, tree-shaken).

  * Renamed with a unique hash for caching.

* **Access**:

You usually **import them in code**:

 import logo from './assets/logo.png'  
\<img src={logo} alt="Logo" /\>

*   
  * In dev mode, you *can* access `/src/assets/...` by direct URL (dev server convenience).

  * In production, that won’t work → they’ll only be available with their hashed name.

* **When to use**:

  * Component images/icons.

  * Fonts, JSON files.

  * Anything bundled into the app.

* **Production**: Renamed and optimized.

  * e.g. `src/assets/logo.png` → `dist/assets/logo.3f2c8d.png`.

---

## **🔑 Key Differences**

| Feature | `public/` | `src/assets/` |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Processing** | Not processed (copied as-is). | Processed, optimized, hashed. |
| **Access in dev** | Always available via `/filename`. | Accessible via `/src/assets/...` or import. |
| **Access in prod** | Same path (e.g. `/logo.png`). | Only via hashed name (must be imported in code). |
| **Best for** | Favicon, manifest, robots.txt, static files. | Images, fonts, icons, JSON used in components. |

---

## **✅ Rule of Thumb**

* **Put files in `public/`** if you want them at a **fixed, predictable URL**.

* **Put files in `src/assets/`** if you need to **use them inside React code** and benefit from optimization.

---

👉 This way:

* `public/` \= “always available, never touched by Vite.”

* `src/assets/` \= “go through Vite’s pipeline, optimized, used in components.”

---

Perfect 🚀 — let’s now combine **all the detailed DOM knowledge**, **React-specific concepts**, and **interview prep Q\&A** into a single structured **Notes \+ Interview Pack**.

---

# **📘 React & DOM — Complete Notes \+ Interview Prep**

---

## **1\. DOM Basics**

### **🔹 What is the DOM?**

* **DOM \= Document Object Model** → a tree-like, in-memory structure that represents the HTML of a page.

* Created by the browser after parsing HTML.

\<div id="root"\>  
  \<h1\>Hello\</h1\>  
\</div\>

DOM tree:

div\#root  
 └── h1 ("Hello")

### **🔹 Key Terms**

* **Node** → Any item in the tree (element, text, attribute).

* **Element Node** → HTML tag like `<div>`.

* **Text Node** → Text content inside elements.

* **Attributes** → Properties on elements (`id`, `class`, etc.).

### **🔹 Core APIs**

* `document.getElementById("root")`

* `document.querySelector("h1")`

* `element.innerHTML = "Hi"`

* `element.setAttribute("class", "blue")`

📌 **Interview Q:** *What’s the difference between HTML and DOM?*  
 ➡️ HTML is the static text file. DOM is the live, interactive, in-memory model the browser creates from it.

---

## **2\. DOM Performance Challenges**

* DOM manipulations are **expensive** because they can cause:

  * **Repaint** → redraw pixels.

  * **Reflow** → recalculate layout of the entire page.

* Updating many elements one-by-one \= slow.

📌 **Interview Q:** *Why is frequent DOM manipulation bad?*  
 ➡️ Because each update can trigger costly reflows/repaints, slowing performance.

---

## **3\. Virtual DOM in React**

### **🔹 What is it?**

* A **lightweight, in-memory copy** of the real DOM.

* React updates the **Virtual DOM (VDOM)** first, not the real DOM.

### **🔹 Update Flow**

1. State changes → React re-renders component → new VDOM created.

2. New VDOM compared with old VDOM (**diffing**).

3. React applies only the minimal set of changes to the real DOM (**reconciliation**).

📌 **Interview Q:** *What is the Virtual DOM and why is it used?*  
 ➡️ It’s a memory-based representation of the real DOM that allows React to perform efficient updates by minimizing costly real DOM operations.

---

## **4\. Reconciliation & Diffing Algorithm**

### **🔹 React’s Rules**

**Different element type?** Replace node entirely.

 \<div /\> → \<span /\>   // React replaces whole node

1.   
2. **Same type?** Update only changed attributes/props.

3. **Lists:** React uses **keys** to track items efficiently.

📌 **Interview Q:** *Why are keys important in React lists?*  
 ➡️ Keys let React identify which list items changed, were added, or removed, improving performance and avoiding bugs.

---

## **5\. ReactDOM & Root Node**

### **🔹 Single Root**

React apps attach to a single DOM node, usually in `index.html`:

\<div id="root"\>\</div\>

### **🔹 Mounting React**

import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client"  
import App from "./App.jsx"

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(\<App /\>)

📌 **Interview Q:** *Why does React need a root node?*  
 ➡️ It needs one DOM container where React manages the UI efficiently.

---

## **6\. Real DOM vs Virtual DOM vs Shadow DOM**

| Feature | Real DOM | Virtual DOM (React) | Shadow DOM (Web Components) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Where it lives | Browser memory | React’s memory | Inside an isolated component |
| Update speed | Slow (expensive reflows) | Fast (diffing \+ batching) | Fast (local scope only) |
| Purpose | Represents the whole UI | Efficient UI updates in frameworks | Encapsulation of styles & markup |

📌 **Interview Q:** *What’s the difference between Virtual DOM and Shadow DOM?*  
 ➡️ Virtual DOM improves performance of updates. Shadow DOM isolates styles and markup for encapsulated components.

---

## **7\. Advanced DOM Concepts in React**

### **🔹 Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components**

* **Controlled** → React manages form values via state.

* **Uncontrolled** → DOM manages values, accessed via `ref`.

### **🔹 Portals**

Render React components outside the root node:

ReactDOM.createPortal(\<Modal /\>, document.getElementById("modal-root"))

### **🔹 Event Delegation**

* React attaches **one global listener** at the root and uses **synthetic events** for efficiency.

📌 **Interview Q:** *How does React handle events differently from native DOM?*  
 ➡️ React uses a synthetic event system and event delegation for cross-browser consistency and performance.

---

## **8\. React Fiber (Interview-Heavy Topic)**

* **React Fiber \= new reconciliation engine (React 16+).**

* Allows React to split rendering work into units → pause, prioritize, resume.

* Enables **concurrent rendering** (React 18).

📌 **Interview Q:** *What is React Fiber?*  
 ➡️ It’s React’s internal engine for rendering & reconciliation that enables features like concurrent rendering and Suspense.

---

Perfect 👍 — let’s **briefly explain** each of these **high-priority React topics** (enough to revise before interviews), and then I’ll give you a **Q\&A bank** with **all possible interview questions \+ answers**.

---

# **📘 React Core Interview Topics (Brief but Powerful)**

---

## **🔹 1\. Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components**

### **Controlled Components**

* Form inputs whose values are **fully managed by React state**.

Example:

 function Form() {  
  const \[name, setName\] \= useState("")  
  return (  
    \<input value={name} onChange={e \=\> setName(e.target.value)} /\>  
  )  
}

* ✅ Benefits: predictable, easy validation, central control.

### **Uncontrolled Components**

* Form inputs where the **DOM itself stores the value**.

* Accessed using `ref`.

Example:

 function Form() {  
  const inputRef \= useRef()  
  return (  
    \<form onSubmit={() \=\> console.log(inputRef.current.value)}\>  
      \<input ref={inputRef} /\>  
    \</form\>  
  )  
}

*   
* ✅ Benefits: quick setup, less boilerplate.

---

## **🔹 2\. React Portals**

* Allow rendering a component **outside the main root node**, but still under React’s control.

* Common uses: modals, tooltips, dropdowns.

Example:

 ReactDOM.createPortal(  
  \<ModalContent /\>,  
  document.getElementById("modal-root")  
)

* 

---

## **🔹 3\. Event Delegation (Synthetic Events)**

* React uses a **synthetic event system** for cross-browser compatibility.

* It attaches **one global event listener** at the root, not on every element.

* Improves performance and provides consistent APIs (`onClick`, `onChange`, etc.).

---

## **🔹 4\. React Fiber**

* Introduced in **React 16** as the new reconciliation engine.

* Enables React to:

  * Split rendering work into **small units**.

  * **Pause, prioritize, and resume** tasks.

  * Support **concurrent rendering** (React 18).

* Key idea: React can be more **responsive** instead of blocking the UI during heavy updates.

---

# **📌 Interview Questions & Answers**

---

### **✅ Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components**

**Q1: What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components?**

* Controlled → React state is the “single source of truth” for input values.

* Uncontrolled → DOM itself keeps the input values, accessed via `ref`.

**Q2: Which one should you use?**

* Use **controlled** for most cases (predictable, validation).

* Use **uncontrolled** for quick forms, file inputs, or when migrating legacy code.

---

### **✅ Portals**

**Q3: What are React Portals?**

* A way to render children into a DOM node outside the main root node.

**Q4: When do you use Portals?**

* For modals, dialogs, tooltips, dropdowns → when elements must “escape” parent styles like `overflow: hidden` or `z-index`.

**Q5: Do portals break event bubbling?**

* No — events still bubble **through the React tree**, not the DOM tree.

---

### **✅ Event Delegation**

**Q6: How does React handle events differently than the DOM?**

* React uses a **synthetic event system**.

* Events are normalized across browsers.

* One listener per event type is attached at the root → efficient.

**Q7: Why does React use synthetic events?**

* Cross-browser consistency.

* Performance (fewer listeners).

* Provides a unified API.

---

### **✅ React Fiber**

**Q8: What is React Fiber?**

* It’s React’s reconciliation engine introduced in React 16\.

* Rewrites how React updates the UI.

**Q9: Why was React Fiber introduced?**

* To allow React to break rendering work into smaller units → can pause, resume, and prioritize.

* Makes apps more responsive, especially for animations and large UI updates.

**Q10: How does Fiber enable concurrent rendering?**

* Fiber scheduling lets React start rendering new updates (like user input) before finishing less urgent updates.

* Improves responsiveness.

---

# **📝 Quick Recap for Interview**

* **Controlled vs Uncontrolled** → Who manages the input value? React or DOM?

* **Portals** → Render outside root, but still in React tree (modals, tooltips).

* **Event Delegation** → React uses one global listener \+ synthetic events.

* **Fiber** → React’s engine for async, prioritized rendering → key to concurrent rendering.
